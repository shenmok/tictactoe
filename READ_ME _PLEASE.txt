My first python project. Dated mid 2022 when i was starting 11th grade.

Used this project to learn pynthon basics and pathlib, tkinter.

No code is from AI but I did ask a senior programmer to guide me to light for the basic framework.
It was he who suggested to use arrays and store the instance of each button as an object in the list.

Review 2026 (Cons)-
- i could have made the code shorter by a proper algorithm
- a class object for the tictactoe board would be better.
- the program still faces issue about draws because my final version of this file got curropted.
- Could have made the UI less blocky but i didn't know much tkinter.

Features-
- If we search online we can find text based tic tac toes which look bad on macs. But this is multi platform and works same everywhere.
- Can find no one using images based tkinter buttons as a tic tac toe board lol.
- The use of arrays to keep track of the x and o and blanks on the board.


I did use the documentation of pathlib, tkinter and some stack overflow and discord for general doubts but in the end the logic is original ( if its worth calling original lol).

I have shared this on GitHub on my profile shenmok.

Thanks for downloading and reading this.
